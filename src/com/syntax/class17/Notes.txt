There are 3 types of variables in Java:
    1. Local
    2. Instance
    3. Static
Class Variables{
int age=10; // instance variable
static double weight=25.5;    // static variable


void method(){
String name="Tuzik";    // local variable
    }
}

Local variable:
If a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
    of code it is called local variable.

Instance variable:
If a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then
    it is called an instance variable.

Static variable:
If a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and it has static
    keyword with it then it is called a static variable.

When to use different variables:
    Local variables - should be always preferred over instance and static.
    Why: because they occupy the computer memory for very short amount of time.
    As soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.

    Instance variables - should be used when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and information
        is expected to be different from object to object.
        Pros: accessible in all the methods of a class.
        Cons: occupy the computer memory for longer period of time than local variable.

    Static variables - should be used when we know that information will stay same for all the objects of a class.
        Pros: single memory location for all objects of a class.
        Cons: stay longer in the memory and can hold only one value at a time.
