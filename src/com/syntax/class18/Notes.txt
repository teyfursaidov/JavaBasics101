Types of variables:
    There are three types of variables local, instance and static.
local variables:
    The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local
        variables.
Pros:
    Save Memory.
Cons:
    Limited access can not be accessed out side of methods or block of code where they are
        declared.
Instance variables:
       The variables which are declared inside a class but, outside a method or block of code
           are called instance variables.
Pros:
    Instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons:
    They occupy the computers memory for longer as compared to local variables.
Static variables:
    If instance variables have the static keyword with them, they are called static variables.
Pros:
    Simgle memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons:
    Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory thatn instance variables.

Access modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in Java that defines from where a certain variable, method or
        a class can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in Java that we can define using three keywords.
    1. Private
    2. Protected
    3. Public
        Types of access are 4
        1. private (keyword is private) - when we use the private keyword with any of the variable, methods or classes
            these can only be accessed within that class.
        2. default (applied when no keyword is used) - applied when we dont use any keyword. default is applied by Java
            to those variables methods or classes etc. Which means these things can only be accessed from the
                same package.
        3. protected - we use the protected class when access is applied class members(variable methods etc.)
            can be accessed from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.
        4. public - public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
