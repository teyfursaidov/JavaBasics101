Access Modifiers in Java:
    Allow us to control the visibility of class
        members(fields, methods, constructors etc.) and classes itself in Java.
A sanity check or sanity test is a basic test to quickly evaluate whether a claim or the result
    of a calculation can possibly be true. It is a simple check to see if the produced
        material is rational (that the material's creator was thinking rationally, applying sanity).

There are 4 access levels and 3 keywords that we use to define these access level fourth level is applied when
        we do not use any access modifier keyword.
Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
    1. private(keyword is also private)
    2. default (no keyword means default access level)
    3. protected (keyword is also protected)
    4. public (keyword is also public)

Rules:
    1. We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields.
        Reason: fields contain the data and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks
            if we do not perform sanity check before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might
                misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access the data.
    2. We can not use access modifiers with local variables

Constructor is shortcut, so that we do not assign each field in main.
    Rule no1
        Constructors do not have return types like int, String or void
    Rule no2
        Name of the constructor should be same as name of the class.
