Constructors in Java:
    Constructors in Java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize the objects of a class.

Rules:
    1. They do not have return types not even void.
    2. Name of the constructor must be same as name of the class.
    3. Constructors can not have non access modifiers like static final etc.
    4. We can use the access modifiers like public private protected with constructors.
    5. If we do not write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler.
    6. We can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments sequence of
        argument or type of arguments should be different.
    7. If we have multiple constructors then Java decides which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.

'This' keyword:
*It is a reserved keyword in Java that we can use to refer to instance variables methods or constructor of class.
    1. 'this' keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables.
    2.  'this' keyword can be used to call the constructor of a class inside another constructors.
    3. We can use 'this' keyword to call the methods of a class.

Rules:
    1. this() should be the first line inside a constructor.
    2. this() can not be used inside a method.

Inheritance.
    Is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors
        or methods of parent class.
    The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create
        new classes that are built upon existing classes.
    When we inherit from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of parent class,
        and we can add new methods and fields also.
* extends keyword used to inherit the properties/methods of a class.
   Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship also known as parent-child relationship.
    Syntax of Inheritance:
            class Subclass-Name extends SuperClass-Name{
            //methods and fields
            }
Advantages of Inheritance:
    Less development time, takes less memory, executes faster.


Types of Inheritance:
    1. Single --> exists single base class and single derived class
    2. Multilevel -->
    3. Hierarchical --> more than one child class(subclasses) / more than one child with same parent class
