Inheritance in Java:
    It is a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class.
Benefits:
    1. Saves time to code
    2. Code duplication is reduced
    3. Execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    1. Classes are tightly coupled.
    2. If we change something in parent class it is also changed in child class.
Types of inheritance:
    There are 4 types of inheritance available. Java supports 3 out of 4.
    1. Single
    2. Hierarchical
    3. Multilevel
    4. Multiple(not supported in Java)
Single inheritance:
    Only one child and one parent class. Child class has a single direct parent.
Example:    class Parent{

            }
                class Child extends Parent{

            }
Hierarchical inheritance:
    Single Parent class and multiple Child classes.
Example:    class Parent{

             }
             class Child1 extends Parent{

             }
             class Child2 extends Parent{

             }

Multilevel inheritance:
    Multiple levels of inheritance.
Example: Class A{

         }
         Class B extends A{

         }
         Class C extends B{

         }

Super keyword:
    It is similar to 'this' keyword only it refers to parent class object.
    Access fields method or constructors of parent class inside the child class.
